# Anki Sight Word Template

This template helps practice sight word recognition by displaying words for a brief time.

## How it Works
- When a card is shown, the sight word appears briefly and then disappears
- Display time is based on word length (longer words show slightly longer)
- Words are centered and sized responsively for both desktop and mobile

## Why it's Useful
- Promotes automatic recognition over decoding, similar to how fluent readers process text
- Mimics the quick recognition needed in actual reading situations

## Usage Tips
- Start with known words to get comfortable with the timing
- Adjust `minDisplayTime` and/or `timePerChar` to get the timing right for yourself
